## Consider the credit card dataset which contains the following columns:

CLIENTNUM: Primary key of the dataset

Attrition_Flag: Indicates if a customer is retained or attrited

Customer_Age: Age of the customer

Gender: Gender of the customer

Dependent_count: Number of people dependent on the customer

Education_Level: Highest level of education of the customer

Income_Category: Range of income of the customer

Credit_Limit: Credit card limit

Total_Revolving_Bal: Pending balance of the credit

Avg_Purchase: Amount of purchase made by the customer on credit card

Total_Trans_Amt: Total transaction amount

Dataset is already uploaded.

Based on the above information, import relevant libraries, and perform the following steps:

1. Create a bivariate plot to find if there is a correlation between credit card limit and average purchase made on the card.

2. Visualise the distribution of values for credit card limit and average purchase made on the card. Also, identify the outliers in the data, if any. 

3. Provide a visual representation of the number of customers in each income group using a bar chart.

4. Plot the frequency distribution of the total transaction amount.

Graphically represent the percentage of customers retained and those attrited. Highlight the latter by slicing it apart from the main pie.
